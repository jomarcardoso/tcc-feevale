the xlists package is an old attempt to implement lists dating back to early
implementations of expl3 and template. As a result it contains a lot of
historical code and conventions no longer appropriate. I did only some minimal
updates to make it work with the new implementations so far.

Issues:

 - documentation (.dtx) currently doesn't compile)

 - lot of code still in old format/conventions
