      <h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNIVERSAL DESIGN:</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The design of products and environments to 
        be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the 
        need for adaptation or specialized design.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors, a working group of architects, product 
        designers, engineers and environmental design researchers, collaborated 
        to establish the following Principles of Universal Design to guide a wide 
        range of design disciplines including environments, products, and communications. 
        These seven principles may be applied to evaluate existing designs, guide 
        the design process and educate both designers and consumers about the 
        characteristics of more usable products and environments. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Principles of Universal Design are presented here, in the following 
        format: name of the principle, intended to be a concise and easily remembered 
        statement of the key concept embodied in the principle; definition of 
        the principle, a brief description of the principle's primary directive 
        for design; and guidelines, a list of the key elements that should be 
        present in a design which adheres to the principle. (Note: all guidelines 
        may not be relevant to all designs.)</font></p>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>PRINCIPLE ONE: Equitable Use</b><br>
      The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1a.</b> Provide the same means of use for all 
        users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.<br>
        <b>1b.</b> Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.<br>
        <b>1c.</b> Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally 
        available to all users.<br>
        <b>1d.</b> Make the design appealing to all users. </font> 
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE TWO: Flexibility in Use</b><br>
      The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2a.</b> Provide choice in methods of use.<br>
            <b>2b.</b> Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.<br>
            <b>2c.</b> Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.<br>
            <b>2d.</b> Provide adaptability to the user's pace.</font> </p>
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE THREE: Simple and Intuitive Use</b><br>
      Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, 
      knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3a.</b> Eliminate unnecessary complexity.<br>
            <b>3b.</b> Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.<br>
            <b>3c.</b> Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.<br>
            <b>3d.</b> Arrange information consistent with its importance.<br>
            <b>3e.</b> Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after 
          task completion.</font> </p>
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE FOUR: Perceptible Information</b><br>
      The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless 
      of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4a.</b> Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, 
        tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.<br>
        <b>4b.</b> Provide adequate contrast between essential information and 
        its surroundings.<br>
        <b>4c.</b> Maximize "legibility" of essential information.<br>
        <b>4d.</b> Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., 
        make it easy to give instructions or directions).<br>
        <b>4e.</b> Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices 
        used by people with sensory limitations.</font> 
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE FIVE: Tolerance for Error</b><br>
      The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental 
      or unintended actions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>5a.</b> Arrange elements to minimize hazards 
        and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, 
        isolated, or shielded.<br>
        <b>5b.</b> Provide warnings of hazards and errors.<br>
        <b>5c.</b> Provide fail safe features.<br>
        <b>5d.</b> Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.</font> 
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE SIX: Low Physical Effort</b><br>
      The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of 
      fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>6a.</b> Allow user to maintain a neutral 
          body position.<br>
          <b>6b.</b> Use reasonable operating forces.<br>
          <b>6c.</b> Minimize repetitive actions.<br>
          </font> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>6d.</b> Minimize sustained physical 
          effort.</font> </p>
      </ul>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE SEVEN: Size and Space for Approach and Use</b><br>
      Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, 
      and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Guidelines:</b> </font> 
      <ul>
        <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>7a.</b> Provide a clear line of sight to important 
        elements for any seated or standing user.<br>
        <b>7b.</b> Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or 
        standing user.<br>
        <b>7c.</b> Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.<br>
        <b>7d.</b> Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or 
        personal assistance.</font> 
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        Please note that the Principles of Universal Design address only universally 
        usable design, while the practice of design involves more than consideration 
        for usability. Designers must also incorporate other considerations such 
        as economic, engineering, cultural, gender, and environmental concerns in 
        their design processes. These Principles offer designers guidance to better 
        integrate features that meet the needs of as many users as possible. <br>
